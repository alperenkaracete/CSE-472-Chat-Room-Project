Project expalanation:
This project provides users with a chat server featuring 10 rooms, with these set of attributes:

Speed and Efficiency.
Good and understable GUI.
Chatting Anonymous (does not requires any information from users.People can chat with nicknames) within 10 Rooms.
Providing security of sended and received messages. (Encryption and decryption)

For running code firstly if operating system is linux:
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev.
you should run this command on terminal and install gtk.
Write console to "make" for compile both client.c and server.c
Than firstly run server.out with ./server.out command.
After you can run clients with client.out command.
After openning client program asks you to enter user name and room number.
After giving username and room number, you can communicate clients which is in same room.
For seeing commands you should write 'commands' to client window.
With 'showRooms' command you can see how many clients are there in 10 rooms.
With 'changeRoom <Room number>' you can change your room. For example -> changeRoom 2 is change your room to room 2.
You can scroll up or down on client window for seeing messages.
Your messages seems you on blue colour and on the right of the client window, other clients seems on yellow color and on the left of the client window.
You can exit from client by pressing clossing button (x) on top right of the client.
Server must be runned before client enters name for connect!!
Program did not tested on other operating systems but on linux it works good.

Files:
readMe -> Instructions about program.
client.c -> client's source code.
server.c -> server's source code.
Makefile -> Makefile for compiling file with only 'make' command. With 'make clean' command, you can delete .o files again.

After compiling:
client.o -> compiled client file.
server.o -> compiled server file.
client.out -> executable file for running client.
server.out -> executable file for running server.
